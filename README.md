The functions used for the analysis of "Alternative splicing induces sample-level variation in gene-gene correlations". This project includes two main functions:

- `InteractionTest.R` provides the function `iat` that implements the variance-component-based interaction test for testing splicing induced inter-sample variation in TE-TE correlation. 
- `JointAssociationTest.R` provides the function `jat` that implements the joint association test for TE-TE correlation and inter-sample variation in TE-TE correlation.
